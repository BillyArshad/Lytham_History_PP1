## **Planning stage**
### **Target Audiences:**
​
Users wants to know more about Lytham as they haven't been there before.
Users loves to see the seaside town in the north-west of England.
Users loves to travel around the world

### **User Stories:**
​
* I want to navigate the pages in the Lytham history website

* I want to contact the local for more information about Lytham.
​
### **Site Aims:**
​
My website is aimed to persuade the travellers who hasn't been visited to Lytham before. Because they're usually going to Lakes District which is the most popular mountain in the UK. I hope they will come here in Lytham through my website.
​
​
### **Wireframes:**
​
I have created my Lytham History wireframes from the software called Balsamiq Wireframes.

Sometimes I need to change if it doesn't work out. 
​
### **Color Scheme:**
​
I have decided to choose colours for my home page design:

#eaded2f7
#antiquewhite
#3a3a3a
#252525

for the footer icons:

#royalblue

For the contact form design:

#010577
#white
#4169e1
#bab3cd
#ccc

For the history page design:

#040202
rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.6)
​
## **Typography**
​
* There are three fonts I have used:
  * Edu SA
  * Oswald 
  * Lato
​
* All fonts were sourced from Google fonts in the Credits section.
​
## **Current Features Common to all pages**
​
#### *Navigation Bar:*

* I gave the user links to each section of the Home, History and Contact pages.
* There are each option that are presented to the user to make it reable.
* On the mobile screens, there are pictures of lytham windmill, lytham library and lytham people to make sure mobile sures have no problem reading my history page.
​
#### *features
​
* Home-Page: I have added my personal image to the home page to introduce myself as a local resident in Lytham for over 20 years.
* History-Page: I have put 4 different images in the history page to introduce them about the history of Lytham.
* Contact-Form: I have included the contact form to allow users to contact me.
​
## **Future-Enhancements**
​
A webpage is a living beast it's going to evolve past the initial stages of release generally, it's always good to discuss where you this the page may go in the future
​
* At the time of making this page i didn't have the understanding to actual send e-mails from the contact form so intergration with email.js to send e-mails would improve the users experience
​
* Due to the subject matter, we have discussed the idea of including a small JS game to engage the user
​
## **Testing Phase**
​
* Validators - I was supposed to take images from the html and css validator websites, but due to the strange bugs depsite my best efforts to add them, I had to leave them out and I am writing down instead.

Here are the messages that I wrote from HTML and CSS validators

W3 HTML validator: 

*Error: End tag section seen, but there were open elements.

From line 41, column 5; to line 41, column 14

/div>↩    </section>↩    <

Error: Unclosed element div.

From line 32, column 9; to line 32, column 29

>↩        <div id="cover-text">↩

W3C CSS validator:
