                    <p>Lytham is founded by the Anglo Saxons in 600AD.</p>
                    <p>The local landowner and squire to miller Richard Cookson have built the windmill on Lytham marshes in 1805. It has the classic color like the white and black combined. Inside in the mill, there was some machinery was salvaged from other local mills.</p>
                    <p>Lytham's library was built in 1878 as a Mechanics Insitute. It was also extended in 1898 to celebrate Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee. It had a small library of books, gymnasium, classrooms and also a reading room where I attended to read some books when I was a teenager. Sadly, the library was closed by Lancashire County Council in September 2016.</p>
                    <p>There was a famous footballer who born in Lytham in 1882, was named as Herbert Swann. He played as a centre forward for the likes of Bury, Plymouth Argyle, Crystal Palace and Queens Park Rangers from 1903 to 1910. He died in Lytham in 1954 at 72. He was the great grandfather of the infamous youtuber Thogdad.</p>
